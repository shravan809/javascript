Exponentiation: 
--------------- 
1.How do you find the square of 4 using Exponentiation? 

let a = 4;
console.log(a**2)
//16 
*/

/*
2.What is 2 ** -2? what will be the output?

//0.25
*/

/*
3.What is (-2) ** 3? 

console.log((-2) ** 3)
//-8
*/
/*
4.What is 8 ** (1/3)? 

console.log(8**(1/3))//2*/

/*
5.What is 1.5 ** 2?

/*
Logical operator: 
----------------- 
1.write a code using the logical operators AND (&&) and OR (||) with all possible combinations of true and false values. 

example: 
console.log(true && true) //true
console.log(true && false)//false
console.log(false && true)//false
console.log(false && false)//false

console.log(true || true) //true
console.log(true || false)//true
console.log(false || true)//true
console.log(false || false)//false
*/

/*
comparison operator: 
-------------------- 
1. write a code using the all comparison operators (==,===,!=,!==,<=,>=,<,>)? 
example:  
let a=2 
let b=4 
console.log(a+2>b-2) //true
console.log(a === b)//false
console.log(a == b)//false
console.log(a !== b)//true
console.log(a != b)//true
console.log(a <= b)//true
console.log(a >= b)//false
console.log(a < b)//true
console.log(a > b)//false
